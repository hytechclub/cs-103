1. Create a new Visual Studio Shortcut
1. Open the Shortcut Properties
1. Append ` /RootSuffix Teaching` to the end of the shortcut
1. Change the name of the shortcut to "Visual Studio (Teaching)"
1. Open it up and configure the settings:

Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Fonts and Colors
- Text Editor
- Statement Completion
- Editor Tooltip
- [All Text Tool Windows]
- [Watch, Locals, and Autos Tool Windows]

This way, your development environment will not be affected, but you will have a nice teaching environment where everything is readable without any additional extensions.
