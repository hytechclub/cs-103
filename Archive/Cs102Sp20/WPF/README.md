Introduce WPF and XAML

## C# 101 Review
Start from scratch and build something like the CS 101 Review solution.

Use the CS 101 Review solution to show some basic C# concepts in the context of UI. Explain the pieces that make up a WPF application:
- `.xaml` files - similar to HTML
- `.xaml.cs` files (code behind)
- `Button_Click` event handler hookup
- Named elements in the XAML markup can be referenced in the code behind
