# Constructors
## Warmup - Recap
Pose the following question to the students:
> What is a C# class?

Discuss the answers the students have, make sure there are no misconceptions.

### Classes
A code template which holds together related information (variables) and functions (methods)
- Consists of the keyword `class`
- Contains a body. That is between `{ }`
- Inside the body it can contain methods, fields, etc

### Methods
A way to interact and interpret the data contained in the class

### Fields / Variables
Placeholders for values (or values)

## Instruction
### Introduce Constructors
Introduce constructors as a way to _instantiate_ an object of a class. [Constructors.pptx](Constructors.pptx) has an example based on the `Dog` class.

## Kahoot
There is a Kahoot covering content pertaining to classes: https://play.kahoot.it/#/k/2653107d-300c-43c5-8791-9531cc0f959a

## Code-Along / Practice
Follow the instructions in [MovieListInstructions.md](MovieListInstructions.md) to complete the code-along activity. Start by creating a new WPF application with the students. Create the `Movie.cs` file and explain the `MainWindow` file. Fill out the `Movie` class, and build up the UI. The students should individually add the button functionality for adding and showing movies. At the end of this part, the student solutions should look like [the MovieList solution](MovieList/).

## Challenges
If the students finish building the basic Movie List, they can attempt the challenges listed in [MovieListChallengesBasic.md](MovieListChallengesBasic.md).

## Solutions
- [MovieList](MovieList/) - Complete version, after the code-along
