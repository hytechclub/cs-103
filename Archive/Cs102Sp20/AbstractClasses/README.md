# Abstract Classes
Introduce abstract classes

## Warm Up - Review
https://create.kahoot.it/details/inheritance-and-polymorphism/57292e38-fe22-43ec-8601-7efc246ae378

## Lecture
PowerPoint: [AbstractClasses.pptx](AbstractClasses.pptx)

## Follow-Along
**TODO: Add the inability to instantiate the class to the Follow-Along**
Revisit the Animals example, make the `Animal` class abstract because a generic `Animal` does not know how to speak. Follow the guide in [AbstractAnimals.md](AbstractAnimals.md).

## Individual
**TODO: Show the class hierarchy of `Shape` by F12ing into it, seeing it is abstract**
The students will create some new `Shape`s, deriving from the built-in `System.Windows.Shapes.Shape` class. `Shape` is an abstract class, so they will get to see how to work with a real-world abstract class. The students should follow the instructions in [IndividualInstructions.md](IndividualInstructions.md).

The beginning part of the individual exercise can be completed as a group. There is a good deal of code provided that the students can copy and paste into their projects.

## Challenges
Challenges are built into the individual exercises.

## Solutions
- [AbstractClassesIntro](AbstractClassesIntro/) - Starting point for follow-along
- [Shapes](Shapes/) - Complete version of the individual activity
