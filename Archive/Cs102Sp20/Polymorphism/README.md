# Polymorphism
Introduce Polymorphism

## Warm Up: Base Class and Derived Class review
Students participate in an activity where they match properties/methods to base/derived classes. A good example to use is fantasy characters for a game.

- Character base class
    - Properties: Name, HitPoints, Gold, Level
    - Actions: Move, Speak, LevelUp
- Knight derived class
    - Properties: SwordType, HorseBreed
    - Actions: SwingSword, Joust
- Wizard derived class
    - Properties: SpellList, WandType
    - Actions: CastSpell, Enchant
- Merchant derived class
    - Properties: ListOfWares
    - Actions: SellItem, BuyItem

Before the session begins, instructors should use the whiteboard to create four columns, one for each class. Each action/property should be on the board in a word bank. When the students arrive, start going through each item from the word bank and have the group decide which item belongs under which class.

## Follow-Along - More Animal updates
