# Inheritance and Polymorphism
Introduce Inheritance and Polymorphism using animals. Then update the MovieList application to use inheritance in order to store different types of movies.

## Warm Up
Ask the students to think of some different modes of transportation. Use [WarmUp.md](WarmUp.md)

### Examples
Bicycle, Car, Bus, Plane

### Commonalities
Maximum Speed, Number of Wheels, Year Built, Number of Seats

### Uniqueness
Bicycle -> type (mountain bike, racing bike, etc)
Car -> make and model
Bus -> fare
Plane -> maximum altitude

## Lecture
There is no lecture this lesson. The discussion from the Warm Up should lead into the Follow-Along activity.

## Follow-Along - Update Dog
Start from the InheritanceIntro solution: [InheritanceIntro](./InheritanceIntro/). Follow the instructions in [AnimalInheritance.md](AnimalInheritance.md) to add another animal class. Then, introduce inheritance as a way to simplify the implementation.

## Individual - More Animals
The students should follow the instructions in [IndividualInstructions.md](IndividualInstructions.md) to add some new classes.

## Solutions
[InheritanceIntro](InheritanceIntro/) - Starting point for follow-along
