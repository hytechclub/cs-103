# Practice
Practice the concepts of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Individual Exercise: Movie List Inheritance
Show the students the completed version of the application that does contain animated movies. Then, allow them to complete the exercise.

Students should start from the MovieListInheritance solution: [MovieListInheritance.sln](MovieListInheritance/MovieListInheritance.sln). Then, they should follow the instructions in the [MovieListInheritanceInstructions](MovieListInheritanceInstructions.md) to add Animated Movies to the application. They will do this by using inheritance and polymorphism. They should build toward [MovieListInheritanceComplete.sln](MovieListInheritanceComplete/MovieListInheritanceComplete.sln).

## Challenges: Updating Movie List
If the students complete the basic individual exercises, they can attempt the challenges.

## Solutions
- [MovieListInheritance](MovieListInheritance/) - Starting point for the individual exercise
- [MovieListInheritanceComplete](MovieListInheritanceComplete/) - Complete version of the individual exercise
