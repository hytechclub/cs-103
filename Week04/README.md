Interfaces

- started with review of inheritance from last week
- each student presented their work, then combined the two classes into one program as a group
- showed some polymorphism and type checking
- got into interfaces using an `IWalk` example
  - `walkingSpeed` property and `walk` method
- walked through an example with the use of the interface
